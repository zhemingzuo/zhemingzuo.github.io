The activation function is introduced to determine the output of neural networks by mapping the resulting values of neurons into a specific range. The activation functions often suffer from `gradient vanishing', `non zero-centred function outputs', `exploding gradients', and `dead neurons', which may lead to deterioration in the classification performance. This paper proposes an activation function generation approach using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang inference in an effort to address such challenges. In addition, the proposed method further optimises the coefficients in the activation function using the genetic algorithm such that the activation function can adapt to different applications. This approach has been applied to a digital forensics application of online grooming detection. The evaluations confirm the superiority of the proposed activation function for online grooming detection using an unbalanced data set.
